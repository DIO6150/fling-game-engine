- Batch could be assigned automatically based on Mesh material/shader
- Batch could be assigned without the call to FGE::Engine::LoadBatches
- Batch could be created without the user needing to call FGE::Engine::CreateBatch
- Batch could have multiple atlases assigned
- Make instance rendering work
- Create a camera class
- Add Collidable and physic simulation
- Add uniform cache in shader class
- Allow mesh to have custom vertex attribute
- Allow engine to upload custom uniform (flexible render pipeline)
- Reorganize files according to their dependencies and relevance (core, data, etc...)
- Make a logging class
- Trouver un rempla√ßant au lieu de invalid_argument dans FGE::Batch::Resize
- UpdateMatrix should take a FGE::Mesh instead of the relevant data for consistency
- Add a move/copy/=operator to all of my classes (consistency + probably better anyway)
- Add more wrapper functions in FGE::Context
- Continue to add relevant Doxygen docs to all class methods
- Make the iterators work in the FGE::ObjectArray class
- Make a simple all purpose container class (like the thing in FGE::Engine used to register object)
