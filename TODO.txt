- Continue to add relevant Doxygen docs to all class methods

- Add a move/copy/=operator to all resources specific classes (consistency + probably better anyway)

- Add more wrapper functions in FGE::Context

- Reorganize files according to their dependencies and relevance (core, data, resources, etc...)

- Use string view instead of string when needed (keys)

- Trouver un rempla√ßant au lieu de invalid_argument dans FGE::Batch::Resize

- UpdateMatrix should take a FGE::Mesh instead of the relevant data for consistency

- Batch could be assigned automatically based on Mesh material/shader
- Batch could be assigned without the call to FGE::Engine::LoadBatches
- Batch could be created without the user needing to call FGE::Engine::CreateBatch
- Batch could have multiple atlases assigned


- Scenes must have lights
- Add Collidable and physic simulation

- Create a camera class
- Make a logging class

- Make instance rendering work

- Allow mesh to have custom vertex attribute
- Allow engine to upload custom uniform (flexible render pipeline)
- Implements uniform registering in shader class
- Add uniform cache in shader class
- Implements Frame Buffer and multiple shader pass

- Make a simple all purpose container class (like the thing in FGE::Engine used to register object)
- Make the iterators work in the FGE::ObjectArray class

- Make a Makefile
